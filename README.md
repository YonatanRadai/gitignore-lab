this is a git ignore lab the task was: 

### Objective
In this lab, you will gain hands-on experience with `.gitignore` files to understand their purpose and learn how to effectively manage untracked files in your Git repositories.

### Overview
When working with Git, itâ€™s important to prevent certain files from being tracked. These might include logs, temporary files, and files containing sensitive information. This lab will guide you through the process of setting up a project and configuring a `.gitignore` file to properly exclude these types of files.

### Scenario
You are tasked with setting up a new project that includes a variety of files, some of which should not be included in the repository due to their nature (logs, temporary files, local configurations).

### Tasks

#### Task 1: Set Up the Repository
1. Create a new directory called `ignore-lab`.
2. Navigate into `ignore-lab`.
3. Initialize a new Git repository.
4. Create the following files:
   - `index.html`
   - `app.js`
   - `style.css`
   - `config.json` (contains sensitive configuration details)
   - `debug.log` (a log file generated by the application)

#### Task 2: Observe Untracked Files
1. Run `git status` to view the untracked files in your repository.
2. Note that all files, including temporary or sensitive files, are listed.

#### Task 3: Create a .gitignore File
1. Create a `.gitignore` file in the repository.
2. Add rules to ignore:
   - All `.log` files using the pattern `*.log`.
   - The `config.json` file.
   - Any file in a directory named `temp`.

#### Task 4: Test .gitignore
1. Verify that `debug.log` and `config.json` no longer appear as untracked files when running `git status`.
2. Create a file `temp/notes.txt` and ensure it is ignored by Git.

#### Task 5: Modify .gitignore
1. Add a rule to ignore all `.css` files using the pattern `*.css`.
2. Realize that `style.css` should be tracked and modify `.gitignore` to explicitly include `style.css` by adding `!style.css`.

#### Task 6: Advanced .gitignore Scenarios
1. Create a directory called `build` with some files inside it.
2. Ignore the entire `build` directory using `build/*`.
3. Add an exception to track `build/README.md` while ignoring the rest of the files in the `build` directory.

#### Task 7: Commit .gitignore
1. Add the `.gitignore` file to the staging area.
2. Commit the `.gitignore` file with a message that describes the changes made (e.g., "Add initial .gitignore rules").

### Submission Requirements
- The `.gitignore` file containing all the rules.
- The final output of `git status` showing the tracked and ignored files.
- A snapshot of the repository structure illustrating which files are ignored and which are tracked.
